## Immersion Experience - Marketing  

Prepare for a real or fictitious product launch by gathering customer insights, developing a positioning strategy, and creating a campaign overview.  

You'll perform three tasks:  

- Gather customer insights using **Copilot Chat**.  
- Draft a positioning strategy using **Copilot in Word**.  
- Create a campaign overview deck using **Copilot in PowerPoint**.  

> **NOTE:** Sample prompts are provided to help you get started. Feel free to personalize them to suit your needs—be creative and explore! If Copilot doesn’t deliver the result you want, refine your prompt and try again. Enjoy the process and have fun experimenting!  

### Task 1: Gather customer insights  

Using **Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat**, conduct market research to collect customer insights for your product launch. Focus on identifying customer needs, key pain points, and competitor strengths and weaknesses. Consider emerging market trends that could impact your positioning strategy.

**Steps**:

- Open a new browser tab and navigate to [M365copilot.com](https://m365copilot.com/).  
- Ensure the **Web mode** tab is selected in Copilot Chat:

**Sample Prompt**:  

```text
I am preparing for a product launch for [product] and need to gather market research insights to better understand my target customers. Please help me identify customer needs, their pain points, and competitor strengths and weaknesses. Include any relevant market trends that could influence the product’s positioning so I can craft an effective launch strategy.
```

> **TIP:** If Copilot’s response is too general, refine your prompt by specifying your industry, target audience, or key competitors.

### Task 2: Develop your positioning strategy  

Using **Copilot in Word**, draft a comprehensive strategy document for brand positioning. Incorporate elements such as an executive summary, target audience, brand messaging, and competitor analysis, using insights gathered in Task 1.  

**Steps**:

- Launch Microsoft Word from your browser ([word.new](https://word.new)) or use the desktop application.
- Enter your prompt where it says **"Describe what you'd like to write"**.
