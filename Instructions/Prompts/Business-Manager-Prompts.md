## Immersion Experience - Business Manager  

Optimize daily tasks by reviewing communications, sending an email, and preparing for an upcoming meeting.  

You'll perform three tasks:  

- Review communications using **Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat**.  
- Prepare meeting talking points using **Copilot in Pages**.

### Task 1: Review communications  

Using **Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat**, gather insights from recent interactions with a specific person about a particular topic or project.

**Steps**:

- Open a new browser tab and navigate to [M365copilot.com](https://m365copilot.com/).
- Ensure the "Work mode" tab is selected in Copilot Chat:

**Sample Prompt**:

```text
Summarize my recent interactions with [/Name of Person] regarding [specific topic or project]. Organize the summary by key points or actions discussed, and include any follow-up items or outstanding questions that may require attention.
```

> **NOTE:** Replace [Name of Person] with the person you’re focusing on, and [specific topic or project] with the relevant topic. Use the **/** character (slash) to reference internal contacts for quick access to recent interactions.
