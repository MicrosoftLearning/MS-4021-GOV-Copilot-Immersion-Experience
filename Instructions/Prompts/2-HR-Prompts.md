## Immersion Experience – Public Sector Human Resources (HR) Professionals

As an HR professional in the public sector, streamlining the hiring process is key to building a capable, mission-aligned workforce—especially when identifying candidates who meet civil service requirements. In this Immersion Experience, you’ll discover how to use Microsoft 365 Copilot to analyze workforce trends, create standardized position descriptions, and develop reusable interview guides. These tools will help you attract, evaluate, and select qualified candidates more efficiently - ensuring a consistent, data-informed hiring process that meets civil service requirements and supports long-term organizational goals.

## Tasks Overview

You’ll perform three tasks:

- Research workforce trends using **Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat**  
- Create a Public Sector position description using **Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat**  
- Design an interview guide using **Copilot in Word**

> **NOTE:** Sample prompts are provided to help you get started. Feel free to personalize them to suit your needs—be creative and explore! If Copilot doesn’t deliver the result you want, refine your prompt and try again. Enjoy the process and have fun experimenting!

### Task 1: Research workforce trends

Using **Copilot Chat**, research current hiring trends across the public sector for your chosen position. Focus on identifying key skills, required qualifications, and evolving workforce needs in public institutions such as government agencies, non-profits, education, and healthcare organizations. This will help ensure your hiring process aligns with current best practices and sector-specific demands.

**Steps**:

1. Open a new browser tab and navigate to [M365copilot.com](https://m365copilot.com/).
2. Ensure the "Work mode" tab is selected in Copilot Chat:

    > **Note:** If the Work/Web toggle is not visible, you're already in **Work mode** by default.
    >
    > To access external web resources (such as workforce trend data), you can switch to **Web mode**, if it’s enabled in your tenant.

3. Enter your prompt in the chat window.

    **Sample Prompt**:

    ```text
    What are the key skills and qualifications needed for [IT program managers] in large public sector agencies? Include emerging trends in digital Public Sector initiatives and workforce modernization.
    ```

    > **NOTE:** Replace [IT program managers] with your selected Public Sector role.

### Task 2: Create a position description

Using **Copilot Chat**, continue the conversation from Task 1 to draft a standardized position description. Ask Copilot to use the trends and qualifications it previously identified to structure a role description. Include sections such as duties, qualifications, agency mission, and any applicable civil service classifications or policy references.

**Sample Prompt**:

```text
Based on the trends and qualifications you shared earlier, create a position description for [IT program managers] in a federal agency. Include sections for job duties, required qualifications, and a summary of the agency’s mission and core values.
```

> **NOTE:** Replace [IT program managers] with your selected role. This description can be used to support internal HR reviews or future public job postings.

> **TIP**  
>
> - Ask Copilot to export the response to a Word document to save the template.  
> - Save the document to your OneDrive and copy the shared URL.  
> - To copy the link, open the saved Word document and select **Share** > **Copy Link**:  
> ![Share link.](../Prompts/Media/share-menu-with-copy-link.png)

### Task 3: Design an interview guide

Using **Copilot in Word**, develop a reusable interview guide tailored to your selected role. Include structured questions to evaluate both technical knowledge and public service values, along with a scoring rubric for consistent candidate evaluation.

**Steps**:

1. Launch Microsoft Word from your browser ([word.new](https://word.new)) or use the desktop app.
2. Enter your prompt where it says **"Describe what you'd like to write"**.

    **Sample Prompt**:

    ```text
    Create an interview guide for [IT program managers] in a [federal agency]. Include questions that assess project management expertise, familiarity with Public Sector procurement or compliance, and alignment with public service values. Add a scoring rubric to guide evaluations.
    ```

    > **NOTE:**
    > - Replace [IT program managers] with the chosen role.
    > - Replace [federal agency] with the relevant public sector organization (e.g., local, state, or national government, educational institution, or defense entity).

    > **TIP:** Paste the shared document link from Task 2 into your prompt to ensure alignment with the position description. You can also type "/" to reference and insert relevant files from OneDrive.
