## Immersion Experience – Public Sector Cybersecurity

Strengthen your agency's cybersecurity posture by using Microsoft 365 Copilot to identify vulnerabilities, surface best practices, and align stakeholders on next steps.

## Tasks Overview

You’ll perform three tasks:

- Identify Security Best Practices using **Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat**  
- Draft a security strategy overview using **Copilot in Word**  
- Create a Security Strategy Presentation using **Copilot in PowerPoint**

> **NOTE:** Sample prompts are provided to help you get started. Feel free to personalize them to suit your needs—be creative and explore! If Copilot doesn’t deliver the result you want, refine your prompt and try again. Enjoy the process and have fun experimenting!  

### Task 1: Identify Security Best Practices

Using **Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat** (Web mode), research the most effective ways to protect your Microsoft 365 tenant from cyber threats. This forms the foundation for your communication and action plan.

**Steps**:

1. Open a new browser tab and go to [m365copilot.com](https://m365copilot.com/).
1. In the upper left, select the **Web** tab to enable web-grounded chat:

1. Enter the following prompt in the chat window:

    ```text
    What are the top 5 best practices to secure my Microsoft tenant from cyber attacks?
    ```

    > **TIP:** You can refine your prompt to focus on specific threats or priorities (e.g., ransomware, insider threats, zero trust, or compliance).

1. Once you have your results, ask Copilot to summarize the best practices into a Word document:

    ```text
    Summarize these best practices and export to a Word document.
    ```

1. Open the linked Word document in the Copilot response, save it to your OneDrive, and get a shareable link for the next task.

    To copy the link, open the document in Word and select **Share > Copy Link**:

### Task 2: Draft a Security Strategy Overview

Using **Copilot in Word**, turn the best practices from Task 1 into a concise document that outlines your agency's proposed Microsoft 365 security priorities. This overview should highlight key risks, actionable recommendations, and next steps for improving tenant security.

You’ll build on the information Copilot Chat provided earlier—use your shared Word document to maintain continuity and ensure accuracy.

**Steps**:

1. Launch Microsoft Word from your browser ([word.new](https://word.new)) or use the desktop application.

2. Enter your prompt where it says **"Describe what you'd like to write"**:

    ![screenshot showing Copilot in Word.](../Prompts/Media/draft-with-copilot.png)

    **Sample Prompt**:

    ```text
    Using [Paste link to your saved Word document from Task 1 here] as a reference, create a concise Microsoft 365 Security Strategy Overview. Include:

    - A brief summary of proposed security priorities
    - The key risks these priorities aim to mitigate
    - Recommended next steps for implementation
    ```

3. Review the draft that Copilot creates. If it meets your needs, you can move on to the next step.

    If you'd like to refine the document further, see the optional **Iterate and Refine** section below.

4. Save the file to OneDrive as **M365 Security Strategy.docx**. You’ll use this document in the next task.

    >**tip:** Make sure the document is saved to OneDrive. Then copy the shared URL (you may be prompted to enable AutoSave or select your OneDrive account).

#### Optional: Iterate and Refine Your Strategy Document

Copilot can help you improve your draft through iteration and feedback. After generating your initial overview, try prompting Copilot to enhance specific sections.

Here are a few examples:

```text
Can you refine this overview to be more persuasive for stakeholders?
```

```text
Make the summary section more concise and impactful.
```

### Task 3: Create a Security Strategy Presentation

Using **Copilot in PowerPoint**, transform your written strategy into a concise, stakeholder-ready presentation. This is your opportunity to communicate your agency’s proposed Microsoft 365 security priorities.

**Steps**:

1. Open PowerPoint from your browser ([powerpoint.new](https://powerpoint.new)) or use the desktop app.

1. Open a new blank presentation and select the **Copilot** icon from the ribbon.

    ![Copilot in Ribbon](../Prompts/Media/copilot-ribbon-powerpoint.png)

1. In the Copilot pane that opens, type in the following prompt.

    **Sample Prompt**:

    ```text
    Create a presentation based on this document: [Paste OneDrive link to your saved M365 Security Strategy.docx here]. 

    Add speaker notes summarizing each slide’s key talking points.
    ```

1. Review the slides and speaker notes Copilot generates. Make any adjustments to align with your intended audience—for example, update the agency name, simplify technical language for executives, or add relevant visuals.
