## Immersion Experience - Senior Official  

Communicate effectively with your department by preparing a strategic message for your next all-staff meeting. You’ll use Microsoft 365 Copilot to draft a speech, generate supporting materials, and ensure consistent communication across formats.

You’ll perform three tasks:

- Draft a speech using **Copilot in Word**.  
- Create a slide presentation using **Copilot in PowerPoint**.  
- Draft an email using **Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat**.

> **NOTE:** Sample prompts are provided to help you get started. Feel free to personalize them to suit your needs—be creative and explore! If Copilot doesn’t deliver the result you want, refine your prompt and try again. Enjoy the process and have fun experimenting!  

### Task 1: Draft an all-staff speech

Using **Copilot in Word**, create a speech for an upcoming all-hands meeting. Focus on sharing recent accomplishments, department priorities, policy or funding updates, and next steps for your team. This speech will set the tone and direction for your agency moving forward.

**Steps**:

1. Launch Microsoft Word from your browser ([word.new](https://word.new)) or use the desktop application.
1. Enter your prompt where it says **"Describe what you'd like to write"**.

    **Sample Prompt**:

    ```text
    Draft a speech for an upcoming all-staff meeting. Highlight:
    
    - Three recent department accomplishments  
    - Two current or upcoming initiatives  
    - Any updates on budget, policy, or staffing  
    - Organizational priorities for the next quarter
    
    Keep the tone professional, optimistic, and aligned with public service values. Here are the bullet points to base the speech on:
    
    - [Insert accomplishments here]  
    - [Insert initiative details here]  
    - [Insert funding or policy updates here]  
    - [Insert priorities here]
    ```

    > **Tip:** Replace the placeholder bullet points with your own notes or copy in content from recent updates, reports, or meeting summaries to help Copilot create a more targeted draft.

1. Save the document for use in the next task. Copy the shared URL from the document (enable AutoSave and select your OneDrive account if prompted).

**Optional – Use Copilot Chat to generate example talking points**:  
If you don’t have specific content prepared, you can simulate or explore possible talking points using **Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat** before beginning your draft.

**Steps**:

1. Open a new browser tab and navigate to [M365copilot.com](https://m365copilot.com/).
1. Ensure the "Work mode" tab is selected in Copilot Chat:

    > **Note:** Depending on your organization's tenant configuration, you may not see the option to switch between **Work** and **Web** modes. If the slider is not visible, you're already in **Work mode** by default.
1. Enter your prompt in the chat window.

    **Sample Prompt**:

    ```text
    Help me generate talking points for a quarterly all-staff meeting. Include:
    - Three recent accomplishments
    - Two current or upcoming initiatives
    - Any updates on budget, policy, or staffing
    - Organizational priorities for the next quarter
    ```

    > **Tip:** You can customize this prompt for your agency or role (e.g., transportation, public health) to create more realistic content. Once ready, copy the talking points into your Word prompt to continue drafting the speech.

### Task 2: Create a presentation from your speech

Using **Copilot in PowerPoint**, transform your speech into a supporting presentation. The slide deck should emphasize key messages in a visual format and help guide the audience during your all-hands meeting.

**Steps**:

1. Open Microsoft PowerPoint from your browser [PowerPoint.new](https://PowerPoint.new) or use the desktop application.

1. Open a new blank presentation and select the **Copilot** icon from the ribbon.

1. In the Copilot pane, select the "Create presentation from file" prompt.

    **Sample Prompt**:

    ```text
    Create a presentation about [Paste link to your saved Word document here]. Include a title slide, closing slide and talking points in the notes. 
    ```

    > **TIP:** After generating the slides, refine them by asking Copilot to **adjust visuals, restructure content, or add specific data points**.

### Task 3: Draft a follow-up email

Using **Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat**, create a follow-up email summarizing your message. This email ensures your communication is accessible to those unable to attend the meeting live and reinforces key points across the department.

**Steps**:

1. Open a new browser tab and navigate to [M365copilot.com](https://m365copilot.com/).
1. Ensure the "Work mode" tab is selected in Copilot Chat:

    ![screenshot showing Work mode tab.](../Prompts/Media/work-mode.png)

    > **Note:** Depending on your organization's tenant configuration, you may not see the option to switch between **Work** and **Web** modes. If the slider is not visible, you're already in **Work mode** by default.
1. Enter your prompt in the chat window.

    **Sample Prompt – General Recap**:

    ```text
    Summarize the key talking points from this speech and draft an email to staff recapping the all-hands meeting. Include major takeaways, any important dates or upcoming milestones, and a call to action encouraging continued engagement.
    
    [Paste the link to your Word document here]
    ```

    **Sample Prompt – For Staff Who Missed the Meeting**:

    ```text
    Write an email to staff who couldn’t attend the all-hands meeting. Summarize the main updates and decisions from the speech linked below.

    [Paste the link to your Word document here]
    ```

    > **TIP:** You can also add tone guidance like: “Keep the tone formal,” “Make it brief,” or “Add a positive closing message.”
